    <h1><em> One Piece</em></h1>
    <p>One Piece (stylized in all caps) is a Japanese manga series written and illustrated by Eiichiro Oda. <br> It has
        been
        serialized in Shueisha's shōnen manga magazine Weekly Shōnen Jump since July 1997, with its individual chapters
        compiled in 107 tankōbon volumes as of November 2023.</br> The story follows the adventures of Monkey D. Luffy
        and
        his crew, the Straw Hat Pirates, where he explores the Grand Line in search of the mythical treasure known as
        the "One Piece" in order to become the next King of the Pirates.</p>

    <h2>Setting</h2>
    <p>The world of One Piece is populated by humans and other races such as dwarves (more akin to faeries in size),
        giants, merfolk, fish-men, long-limbed tribes, long-necked people known as the Snakeneck Tribe, and animal
        people (known as "Minks"). The world is governed by an intercontinental organization known as the World
        Government, consisting of dozens of member countries. The Navy is the sea military branch of the World
        Government that protects the known seas from pirates and other criminals. There is also Cipher Pol which is a
        group of agencies within the World Government that are their secret police. While pirates are major opponents
        against the Government, the ones who really challenge their rule are the Revolutionary Army who seeks to
        overthrow them. The central tension of the series pits the World Government and their forces against pirates.
        The series regularly emphasizes moral ambiguity over the label "pirate", which includes cruel villains, but also
        any individuals that do not submit to the World Government's authoritarian—and often morally ambiguous—rule.
        <br> The
        One Piece world also has supernormal characteristics like Devil Fruits, <sup> [Jp 1]</sup> which are mysterious
        fruits that
        grant whoever eats them transformative powers. Another supernatural power is Haki,[Jp 2] which grants its users
        enhanced willpower, observation, and fighting abilities, and it is one of the only effective methods of
        inflicting bodily harm on certain Devil Fruit users.

    <h4>Premise</h4>
    <p>The series focuses on Monkey D. Luffy—a young man made of rubber after unintentionally eating a Devil Fruit—who
        sets off on a journey from the East Blue Sea to find the deceased King of the Pirates Gol D. Roger's ultimate
        treasure known as the "One Piece", and take over his prior title. In an effort to organize his own crew, the
        Straw Hat Pirates,[Jp 15] Luffy rescues and befriends a pirate hunter and swordsman named Roronoa Zoro, and they
        head off in search of the titular treasure. They are joined in their journey by Nami, a money-obsessed thief and
        navigator; Usopp, a sniper and compulsive liar; and Sanji, an amorous but chivalrous cook. They acquire a ship,
        the Going Merry[Jp 16]—later replaced by the Thousand Sunny[Jp 17]—and engage in confrontations with notorious
        pirates. As Luffy and his crew set out on their adventures, others join the crew later in the series, including
        Tony Tony Chopper, an anthropomorphized reindeer doctor; Nico Robin, an archaeologist and former Baroque Works
        assassin; Franky, a cyborg shipwright; Brook, a skeleton musician and swordsman; and Jimbei, a whale shark-type
        fish-man and former member of the Seven Warlords of the Sea who becomes their helmsman. Together, they encounter
        other pirates, bounty hunters, criminal organizations, revolutionaries, secret agents, different types of
        scientists, soldiers of the morally-ambiguous World Government, and various other friends and foes, as they sail
        the seas in pursuit of their dreams.</p>
    <h5>Concept and creation</h5>
    <p> <i> Eiichiro Oda's</i> interest in pirates began in his childhood, watching the animated series Vicky the
        Viking, which
        inspired him to want to draw a manga series about pirates.[2] The reading of pirate biographies influenced Oda
        to incorporate the characteristics of real-life pirates into many of the characters in One Piece; for example,
        the character Marshall D. Teach is based on and named after the historical pirate Edward "Blackbeard" Teach.[3]
        Apart from the history of piracy, Oda's biggest influence is Akira Toriyama and his series Dragon Ball, which is
        one of his favorite manga.[4] He was also inspired by The Wizard of Oz, claiming not to endure stories where the
        reward of adventure is the adventure itself, opting for a story where travel is important, but even more
        important is the goal.[5]

        While working as an assistant to Nobuhiro Watsuki, Oda began writing One Piece in 1996.[6] It started as two
        one-shot stories entitled Romance Dawn[6]—which would later be used as the title for One Piece's first chapter
        and volume. They both featured the character of Luffy, and included elements that would appear later in the main
        series. The first of these short stories was published in August 1996 in Akamaru Jump and later in One Piece
        Red. The second was published in the 41st issue of Weekly Shōnen Jump in 1996, and reprinted in 1998 in Oda's
        short story collection, Wanted!.[7] In an interview with TBS, Takanori Asada, the original editor of One Piece,
        revealed that the manga was rejected by Weekly Shōnen Jump three times before Shueisha agreed to publish the
        series.[8]</p>
