    <h1>You Are My <em> Sunshine</em></h1>
    <div>
        <p>You are my sunshine
            <br> My only sunshine</br>
            You make me happy
            <br> When skies are gray </br>
        </p>
    </div>

    <span>
        <p> You'll never know, dear
            <br> How much I love you</br>
            Please don't take
            <br> My sunshine away </br>
        </p>
    </span>

    <div>
        <p> The other night, dear
            <br> As I lay sleeping </br>
            I dreamed I held you
            <br>In my arms</br>
    </div>
    </p>

    <span>
        <p> When I awoke, dear
            <br>I was mistaken</br>
            So I hung my head and I cried
        </p>
    </span>

    <div>
        <p>You are my sunshine
            <br>My only sunshine</br>
            You make me happy
            <br>When skies are gray </br>
        </p>
    </div>

    <span>
        <p> You'll never know, dear
            <br>How much I love you</br>
            Please don't take
            <br>My sunshine away </br>
        </p>
